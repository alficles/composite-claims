1.  Introduction

   Composition claims are claims defined for CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs)
   [RFC7519].  These claims include logical operators "or", "nor", and
   "and" as well as a wrapper that encrypts the values, but not the
   keys, of some claims.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document reuses terminology from CWT [RFC7519] and COSE
   [RFC9052].

   This term is defined by this specification:

   Composition Claim  A composition claim is a CWT claim that contains,
      as part of its value, one or more CWT claim sets.

3.  Claims

   Composition claims identify claim sets and define how the
   acceptability of the claim sets affects the acceptability of the
   composition claim.

   In CWTs without composition claims, there is exactly one set of
   claims, so the acceptability of the claim set decides the
   acceptability of the CWT.  However, this document defines multiple
   sets of claims, so it instead refers to accepting or rejecting claim
   sets.  If the primary claim set is unacceptable, the CWT is
   unacceptable and MUST be rejected.

   Composition claims can be nested to an arbitrary level of depth.
   Implementations MAY limit the depth of composition nesting by
   rejecting CWTs with too many levels but MUST support at least four
   levels of nesting.

3.1.  Logical Claims

   These claims allow multiple claim sets to be evaluated.  This claim
   identifies one or more sets of claims in a logical relation.  The
   type of these claims is array and the elements of the array are maps
   that are themselves sets of claims.

3.1.1.  or (Or) Claim

   The "or" (Or) claim identifies one or more sets of claims of which at
   least one is valid.  If every set of claims in an "or" claim would,
   when considered with all the other relevant claims, result in the
   claim set being rejected, the claim set containing the "or" claim
   MUST be rejected.

   Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.  The Claim Key [add key number] is
   used to identify this claim.

3.1.2.  nor (Not Or) Claim

   The "nor" (Nor) claim identifies one or more sets of claims of which
   none are valid.  If any set of claims in a "nor" claim would, when
   considered with all other relevant claims, result in the claim set
   being accepted, the claim set containing the "nor" MUST be rejected.

   This is the logical negation of the "or" claim.

   Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.  The Claim Key [add key number] is
   used to identify this claim.

3.1.3.  and (And) Claim

   The "and" (And) claim idenfies one or more sets of claims of which
   all are valid.  If any claim in an "and" claim would, when considered
   with all other relevant claims, result in the claim set being
   rejected, the claim set containing the "and" claim MUST be rejected.

   The "and" claim is often unnecessary because a given claim set is
   only accepted when all its claims are acceptable.  However, CBOR maps
   cannot have duplicate keys, so claims cannot be repeated more than
   once.  The "and" claim is useful for claims that may be claimed
   multiple times, including the "or" and "nor" claims.

   Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.  The Claim Key [add key number] is
   used to identify this claim.

3.2.  Enveloped Claims

   Eveloped claims identify a set of claims that should be considered as
   part of a set of claims, but that require decryption before they can
   be processed.  This is sometimes useful when some processors do not
   need to evaluate some claims in order to determine if a claim set is
   acceptable.

3.2.1.  env (Enveloped) Claim

   The "env" (Enveloped) claim allows an issuer to make private claims
   that cannot be read by a processor that does not possess the
   decryption key.  The type of this claim is a map; the keys of the map
   are either claim keys (string, unsigned integer, or negative integer)
   or arrays of claim keys; the values of the map are COSE_Encrypt or
   COSE_Encrypt0 objects, as defined by Section 5 of [RFC9052].  The
   plaintext of the Enveloped Message is either a CBOR data item or a
   CBOR array of data items.

   Each element of the map is interpreted as follows:

   *  If the key is a claim key, the plaintext of the Enveloped Message
      in its value is a CBOR data item that is appropriate as a value
      for that claim.
   *  If the key is an array of claim keys, the plaintext of the
      Enveloped Message in its value is an array with the same
      cardinality as the array of claim keys.  Each member of the array
      in the plaintext corresponds with the member in the array in the
      key with the same index.  The members of the array in the
      plaintext are CBOR data items that are appropriate as values for
      the corresponding claim.

   For each claim described in the "env" claim that the processor can
   decrypt, the claim MAY be processed exactly as though it were a
   sibling claim to the "env" claim, including the limitation that a map
   of claims is invalid if it contains a claim more than once.  An
   invalid claim set MUST be rejected.  A claim set that contains
   duplicate claims MUST be rejected, even if the duplicates are not
   decrypted.

   Since claims are optionally decrypted and added as sibling claims,
   issuers can ensure that this occurs by adding them to the "crit"
   claim.

   Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.  The Claim Key [add key number] is
   used to identify this claim.

3.2.2.  crit (Critical) Claim

   The "crit" (Critical) claim lists the claims required to process this
   token.

   The type of this claim is array and the elements of the array are
   strings, negative integers, or unsigned integers.  The elements of
   the array correspond to claims that may be present in the token.

   If a claim listed in the "crit" claim is present in a claim set and
   the processor cannot understand or process the claim, the claim set
   MUST be rejected.

   If a claim listed in the "crit" claim is not present in a claim set,
   the claim set MUST be rejected.

   If a claim listed in the "crit" claim is present in a claim set as
   part of a "env" claim (and, should it be decrypted, be processed as a
   sibling of that "env" claim), if the value of the claim is not
   decrypted (for any reason) and processed and any possible value of
   the claim would result in the request being rejected, the claim set
   MUST be rejected.  Since any processor MAY decrypt or not decrypt
   claim values in a "env" claim, this means a processor MAY reject any
   claim set that contains a claim that could have a value that would
   require rejection.

   If a "crit" claim is present in a claim set, a processor SHOULD
   consider claims it does not understand to be acceptable if they are
   not present in the "crit" claim.  That is, when a "crit" claim is
   present, any claims not listed may be assumed to be non-critical.

   Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.  The Claim Key [add key number] is
   used to identify this claim.

4.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations relevant to CWTs in general will apply to
   CWTs that use composition claims.

   Additionally, processors of CWTs with composition claims will need to
   be aware of the possibility of receiving highly nested tokens.
   Excessive nesting can lead to overflows or other processing errors.

   The security of the "env" claim is subject to all the considerations
   detailed for COSE objects in Section 12 of [RFC9052].

5.  IANA Considerations

   [When claims keys have been identified and selected, this section
   will ask IANA to register those keys.]
